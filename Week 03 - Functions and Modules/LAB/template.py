# =================================================================== FUNCTIONS
# 1. Write a function called status_of(percent) that returns "OVER LIMIT"
def status_of(percent):
    """Return a status string based on the percentage."""
    if percent >= 100:
        return "OVER LIMIT"
    elif percent >= 90:
        return "WARNING"
    else:
        return "OK"
def check(value, limit):
    """Return the difference and percentage of value vs limit."""
    difference = value - limit
    percent = (value / limit) * 100 if limit != 0 else 0
    return difference, percent


# ==================================================================== INPUT
# 2. Ask for your three values.
#
#    - the first is TEXT      (a name, a hostname, an IP)  -> no conversion needed
#    - the second is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())
#    - the third  is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())

label = input("enter ip source: ")  # replace with an input() call
value = float(input("enter value: "))  # replace with an input() call, converted
limit = float(input("enter limit: "))  # replace with an input() call, converted


# ================================================================== PROCESS
# 3. Work out the difference, the percentage, and the status.
#
#    Threshold : call status_of() to get the status. Work out the
#                difference and percentage inline, not in a function.
#    Typical   : call check() to get the difference and percentage instead.

difference, percent = check(value, limit)
status = status_of(percent)

# =================================================================== OUTPUT
# 4. Print the report.
#
#    Threshold : the three values you were given, plus status, inside a border
#    Typical   : add difference and percent, 2 decimal places, right-aligned
#    Excellent : call print_report() instead of printing directly here, and
#                wrap sections 2-4 in a loop so you can check as many records
#                as you like in one run - type "quit" as the label to stop.
#                Keep count of how many came back OVER LIMIT and print that
#                once, after the loop ends.

print()
print("=" * 34)
print(f"  RECORD CHECK  -  {label}")
print("=" * 34)

# your report lines go here
print(f" failed logins: {value:>10.2f}")
print(f" total allowed: {limit:>10.2f}")
print(f" difference:    {difference:>10.2f}")
print(f" percentage:    {percent:>10.2f}%")
print(f" status:        {status:>10}")



# ==========================================================================
# 5. Before you finish:

#    [ ] Run it three times with different numbers
#    [ ] Run it with a total of 0 and note the error (do not fix it yet)
#    [ ] Check every function does one job - if a function both calculates
#        and prints, split it
